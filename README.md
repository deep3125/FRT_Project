# FRT_Project
About 56 to 60 million people die each year due to various reasons. Many of them can be saved by just taking care of their health and wellbeing. While this goal of saving lives is achievable in theory but practically, many of us are too busy or/and are not aware of this. This project aims at analysing the factors that cause the death of so many people. These analytics are provided to the public through Azure Cloud, thus helping them make well-informed decisions saving many lives. Analytics using charts, slicer, in an excel workbook. A static HTML page is hosted using the static website option in the Azure Storage service. This page also contains the embed code(using iframe) of the previously mentioned excel workbook.
